## Introduction

This repository is a collection of code and exercises from the JavaScript course by Meta on Coursera. It is intended for personal reference and practice. Throughout this course, I learned how to effectively write and structure JavaScript code, working with different programming paradigms, testing, and modern JavaScript features.

## Course Structure

The repository is organized into several modules, each corresponding to a different aspect of JavaScript covered in the course:

### Module 1: Introduction to JavaScript
In this module, you are introduced to JavaScript and learn why it is integral to software development. You'll gain an understanding of how to write JavaScript code inside the browser and become familiar with key operators, conditional statements, and loops. By the end of this module, you'll have a foundational knowledge of JavaScript syntax and control flow.

- **Topics covered**:
  - JavaScript syntax and structure
  - Operators and expressions
  - Conditional statements (if, else)
  - Loops (for, while)

### Module 2: The Building Blocks of a Program
In this module, you'll dive into core JavaScript concepts such as objects, arrays, and functions. You'll learn about the most common built-in methods and how to handle undefined, null, and empty strings. This module also introduces error handling and defensive programming to improve code robustness.

- **Topics covered**:
  - Objects and arrays
  - Functions and their use
  - Built-in methods and properties
  - Undefined, null, and empty strings
  - Error handling and defensive programming

### Module 3: Programming Paradigms
This module focuses on functional and object-oriented programming (OOP). You'll explore JavaScript’s scoping mechanisms, and the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`. You'll also learn about classes, inheritance, and modern features like the spread and rest operators. The module emphasizes building interactive web pages through DOM manipulation and handling events using JavaScript.

- **Topics covered**:
  - Functional programming and OOP paradigms
  - Scope in JavaScript
  - `var`, `let`, and `const`
  - Classes and inheritance
  - Modern JavaScript features: spread and rest operators
  - DOM manipulation and event handling
  - JSON in JavaScript

### Module 4: Testing
In this module, you'll explore testing in JavaScript using Node.js and npm. You'll learn how to install and use npm packages, work with `package.json`, and write simple unit tests using Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework. This module prepares you for ensuring the correctness of your code through testing.

- **Topics covered**:
  - Introduction to Node.js and npm
  - Working with `package.json`
  - Writing unit tests in Jest

### Module 5: End-of-Course Graded Assessment
The final module allows you to apply everything you've learned to create a "Little Lemon Receipt Maker." You will synthesize your skills to build a JavaScript application, and after completing the individual units, you’ll take the final graded assessment. This module helps you reflect on the course content and provides guidance for further learning in JavaScript.

- **Topics covered**:
  - Building a JavaScript application using learned skills
  - Final project: Little Lemon Receipt Maker
  - Final quiz
